            <p>JANICE:	Good morning, sir. My name is Janice. How can I help you today?</p>
            <p>MARK:	Hi, Janice. I’d like to see the vacation packages for Universal Resorts Orlando.</p>
            <p>JANICE:	Great. What’s your name?</p>
            <p>MARK:	Mark.</p>
            <p>JANICE:	OK, Mark. Are you traveling alone or in a group?</p>
            <p>MARK:	I’m taking my wife and son on a family trip!</p>
            <p>JANICE:	Nice. We have a great 8-day package including accommodation and admission to all Universal Orlando Resort parks.</p>
            <p>MARK:	And what are the benefits of this package?</p>
            <p>JANICE:	A lot! You and your family are staying in a great hotel inside the Universal Resort. We offer free shuttle to the parks, so you don’t have to worry about parking. Plus, you have access to the parks an hour before they open to the general public. </p>
            <p>MARK:	That sounds good. And how much is it for the three of us?</p>
            <p>JANICE:	Let me see…How old is your son?</p>
            <p>MARK:	He’s nine. Why are you asking?</p>
            <p>JANICE:	Oh, because children under two don’t need admission tickets and can stay in Universal hotels free of charges.</p>
            <p>MARK:	I see.</p>
            <p>JANICE:	But children from 3 to 9 can have the admission tickets at a discounted price as well.</p>
            <p>MARK:	Excellent!</p>
            <p>JANICE:	So, the vacation package for the three of you for eight nights with all admission tickets is 2.470 dollars.</p>
            <p>MARK:	That’s not bad. Let’s close the deal.</p>
